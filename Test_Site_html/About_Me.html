        <div>
            <p>I am a person who has always wanted to dig deep into a topic and see how it everything ticks. 
                My family comes from a long line of Cajuns living in rural Louisiana, so when my parents packed us up and moved up north to Michigan I saw it as a grand adventure. 
                All the different people, places, and seasons, I just had to dive in and figure it all out. 
                This of course translated well into school where my natural inquisitiveness allowed me to excel in every class I took. 
                More importantly though, I was loving it the entire time.
            </p>

            
            
            <p>Moving back to Louisiana was just as much of a joy as I could learn just as much about where I came from, putting salt back in food instead of the road and joining wrestling teams instead of hockey. 
                From here, I took a major in anthropology and career in archaeology after I graduated. 
                This provided ample opportunity to discover more about the past and encounter new and interesting puzzles. 
                The field was an unpredictable place full of challenges and puzzles that kept me mentally engaged and challenged my faculties. 
                However, the constant lifestyle of going from middle of nowhere hotel to middle of nowhere hotel left me feeling isolated as well as purposeless.
            </p>
            
            <p>Finally, I decided it was time to settle down and get some direction in my life. 
                Boston is a thriving city filled to the brim with possibility, so I decided to make it my home. 
                I required both mental rigor and stability in my new career path.
                After making new friends in Boston I began to become fascinated with all of the things they could do with tech. 
                I fiddled with Arduinoâ€™s, classes, and language libraries until I became the man that you see today.
